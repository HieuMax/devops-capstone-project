    Title: Need the ability to automate continuous integration checks

    **As a** Developer
    **I need** automation to build and test every pull request
    **So that** I do not have to rely on manual testing of each request, which is time-consuming

    #### Assumptions
    * GitHub Actions will be used for the automation workflow
    * The workflow must include code linting and testing 
    * The Docker image should be postgres:alpine for the database
    * A GitHub Actions badge should be added to the README.md to reflect the build status

    #### Acceptance Criteria
    ```gherkin
    Given code is ready to be merged
    When a pull request is created
    Then GitHub Actions should run linting and unit tests
    And the badge should show that the build is passing
    ```
